PIG data types can be divided into two types:

1.	Scalar Data type: contains a single value.
2.	Complex Data type: contain other value.
3.  Null Values 

Scalar Data types are as follows
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Normal Languages / PIG
-----------------------
int / int
String / Chararray
Float / Float
Double / Double 
Long / Long
Boolean	/ Boolean
Byte / Bytearray
Tuple /	Tuple

Complex Datatypes are as follows:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The data model of Pig Latin is fully nested and it allows complex non-atomic datatypes such as atom, bag, relation, map and tuple. 
  
Atom----------

Any single value in Pig Latin, irrespective of their data, type is known as an Atom. 
It is stored as string and can be used as string and number. int, long, float, double, chararray, and bytearray are the atomic values of Pig. A piece of data or a simple atomic value is known as a field.
Example − ‘raja’ or ‘30’

Tuple----------

A record that is formed by an ordered set of fields is known as a tuple, the fields can be of any type. A tuple is similar to a row in a table of RDBMS.
Example − (Raja, 30)

Bag----------

A bag is an unordered set of tuples. In other words, a collection of tuples (non-unique) is known as a bag.
Each tuple can have any number of fields (flexible schema).
A bag is represented by ‘{}’.
It is similar to a table in RDBMS, but unlike a table in RDBMS, it is not necessary that every tuple contain the same number of fields 
or that the fields in the same position (column) have the same type.
Example − {(Raja, 30), (Mohammad, 45)}
A bag can be a field in a relation; in that context, it is known as inner bag.
Example − {Raja, 30, {9848022338, raja@gmail.com,}}

Map----------

A map (or data map) is a set of key-value pairs. The key needs to be of type chararray and should be unique. 
The value might be of any type. It is represented by ‘[]’
Example − [name#Raja, age#30]

Relation----------

A relation is a bag of tuples. 
The relations in Pig Latin are unordered (there is no guarantee that tuples are processed in any particular order).

Null Values
------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is possible that values for all the above data types can be NULL. 
However, SQL and Pig treat null values in the same way.
On defining a null Value, It can be an unknown value or a non-existent value. 
Moreover, we use it as a placeholder for optional values. 
Either, These nulls can be the result of an operation or it can occur naturally.
